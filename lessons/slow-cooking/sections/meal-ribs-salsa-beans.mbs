Now that we've _mastered cooking_ with _dried beans_ and _braising_, we've learned how a _small amount of effort_, plus _patience_, can result in _big flavours_. And it's time to _put it all together_.

Part of what I want you to get out of this is _how to prep a meal in advance_, particularly to _make hosting easier_. Rather than think of this as a _meal_ we're trying to get _on the table_ by _7 p.m. on a work night_, let's say we're _planning dinner_ for _Friday_. We've got _friends_ coming over _at 8_, which gives them time to hit the gym after work, shower and relax a bit before rushing to your home. And if we take this approach to _meal planning_, it will mean that we are _in no hurry_ on _Friday_ either.

_Make the beans_ and _braise the short ribs_ early in the week. On Friday, you will have _all your major prep done_ and be able to _assemble _an impressive tasting meal with _minimal effort_.

__Friday Night:__

You've _just gotten home_ from work. _Guests_ are coming _at 8_. The _good news_ is that you've got _cooked beans_ and _braised meat_ sitting _in your fridge_, ready to be _heated_ and _finished_. So you can _take your time_ with the _fresh produce_ you'll need to _fill this out_ into a _balanced meal_.

For _best results_, have your _beans/kale dish_ finished and your _pomegranate salsa_ ready _before you reheat_ your braise.

_Refrigerate_ until _dinnertime_.

### Navy Beans & Kale

I’d make this one hour before dinner. As soon as it’s done, pull it off the stove and just reheat it when you’re ready to serve.

Now reheat the braised beef ribs, using one of the methods described above. When your ribs are hot, assemble all the ingredients on a plate and serve.
