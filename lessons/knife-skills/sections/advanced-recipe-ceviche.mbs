Understandably, once you’ve _learned_ to use a _chef’s knife_, you want to use it. And you _want something fancier_ to show for it. Here’s a recipe for a dish that _seems fancy_ but is in fact _very easy_. While it _does not require cooking_, it does present _ample opportunity_ to _practice_ your _knife work_.

_Ceviche_ is just _fish_ prepared in a _bath of citrus juice_. Some people say “cooked” or “cured”. It’s actually a _chemical process_ called _denaturing_, which _breaks_ many of the _bonds_ that hold _protein molecules_ in their shape. The _acid_ of _lemon or lime_ changes the _fish’s flesh_ from its plush, raw, _translucent state_ to an _opaque firmness_ (and flavours it as well). The _type_ of fish _doesn’t matter_. Sea bream, tuna, arctic char or halibut all _work fine_. So long as it _isn’t_ a really _dense fish_, like pickerel or catfish. It just has to be _as fresh as possible_.

The _larger_ the piece, the _longer_ it takes the _acid_ to _reach the centre_ of the _fish_. With a _dark fish_ like tuna, you’ll _see_ it _change colour_ very _quickly_. _Season_ with _salt_ and you’ve got ceviche of the most basic kind.

Some people like to _leave it overnight_ but with _bite-sized_ pieces of fish, it only needs _five minutes_ for the citrus to permeate. How much _lime juice_? _Start_ with _half a lime_ and _taste_ it. If your fish is _fresh enough_ to be used _for ceviche_, it’s fresh enough to be eaten as _sushi_.

> Don’t know how to pick out fresh fish or talk to your fishmonger? Here’s <a href='http://www.chatelaine.com/food/kitchen-tips/how-to-buy-sustainable-seafood/' target='_blank'>a guide I wrote for Chatelaine.</a>

The _essential technique_ is just _fish_ and _lime juice_; anything you add is just to round out the dish. I’ve seen _100 different versions_ of this _Latin American_ dish, served with yuzu, apples, kumquats, sesame oil, edamame, lemongrass, watermelon, etc. The most _common presentation_ is with _chilli_, _onion_, _cilantro_, _sweet potato_, and _corn_.

For a _no-cooking_ version, stick with the _chilli_, _onions_ and _cilantro_. You can _use the onion_ to _practice slicing_ as thin as possible and the _chilli_ for _chopping_ as small as possible (aka _mincing_). _Cilantro_ is a hearty herb. Unlike basil or oregano, it _won’t bruise_ if you _chop it roughly_. A few slices of _avocado_ or _corn chips_ should turn this into a dish.
