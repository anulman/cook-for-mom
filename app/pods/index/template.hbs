      {{! todo affiliate? }}
      <li> <strong>A good chef's knife</strong>, like <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008GRUNOC' target='_blank'>this one from Wusthof</a></li>

      <li> <strong>A stainless steel pan</strong>, like <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JAP44MQ' target='_blank'>this Tramontina skillet</a></li>
      <li> <strong>A rolling pin</strong>, like <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IYYFIQ' target='_blank'>this maple dowel</a> (though a wine bottle will do in a pinch!)</li>
