<p> Hello new cook. Welcome to <em>Week One</em> of {{link-to 'Cook For Mom' 'index'}}. In an ideal world, we humans would be born with the ability, confidence and <em>cooking skills</em> to feed ourselves. But if you’ve signed up for this <em>series of lessons</em> in order to make dinner for your mother, well that’s great too. </p>
<p> I assume you’ve peeked at {{!todo link}}<em>week six</em> and its recipe for a <em>multi-course meal</em>, and are wondering how we’re going to get there from week one, where we’re starting by making <em>a salad</em>. Before we can prepare a good cassoulet, the elements of white beans, lamb sausage and confit duck all in perfect harmony, we need to learn the <em>essential skills</em> of working with a <em>kitchen knife</em>. First of all, <em>don’t feel bad</em> because you don’t know how to cook. No one taught you. It’s not part of our public education. But, starting now, that’s what we’re going to do. </p>
<p> Well, I’ve got some <em>good news</em> and bad news for you. Cooking is <em>work</em>. Just like exercise is work, relationships are work and work is work. There are <em>no shortcuts</em>. But just like those other areas, if you put in the work, you are <em>guaranteed to improve</em> and <em>reap profound benefits</em>. Your life will be better for it and you will wonder why you didn’t learn sooner. </p>
<p> This first lesson is going to be <em>super simple</em>. We won’t be using any heat, just raw ingredients, focussing instead on <em>knife use</em> and <em>safety</em>. </p>
