<p> It would be <em>preposterous</em> to give you <em>measurements</em> for things like <em>lettuce</em> and <em>carrots</em>. Instead, let me <em>suggest tips</em> for preparing each of the <em>ingredients on this list</em>. And the <em>only direction</em> is, pick <em>at least three items</em> (at least <em>one with crunch</em>) and <em>combine them</em> in a <em>bowl</em> with <em>dressing</em>. Though whatever you do, <strong>DON’T EVER</strong> dress a salad <em>in advance</em>. If you’re <em>packing a salad</em> for the office, the <em>acid</em> in a dressing will just <em>wilt</em> and <em>sog</em> the <em>vegetables</em> by lunchtime. </p>
<p> <strong>Lettuce</strong>—Yes, you have to <em>wash lettuce</em>. It’s annoying. And you can <em>buy pre-washed</em> lettuce. But it <em>doesn’t stay fresh</em> long. Even <em>organic lettuce</em> needs to be washed, as it usually <em>contains soil</em> near the stem. If you don’t have a <em>salad spinner</em>, just <em>rinse each leave</em> and <em>submerge</em> all of it in a <em>bowl of cold water</em>. <em>Strain</em> and let to <em>dry on towels</em>. <em>Store lettuce</em> in the <em>fridge</em> in a <em>container</em> with a <em>damp cloth over top</em>. </p>

<p> <strong>Tomato</strong>—I’m no fan of tomatoes in salad. Most have <em>too much water</em> content. Stick with <em>cherry tomatoes</em>. But if you’re using larger tomatoes, <em>remove</em> the juicy <em>middle section</em> (ideally to toss into a tomato sauce or beef stock, which we will get to in week 3). </p>
<p> <strong>Kale</strong>—There are <em>multiple species</em> of kale on supermarket shelves — redbor, red Russian, curly, Siberian and cavolo nero (aka Tuscan or dinosaur kale). The <em>cavolo nero</em> is terrific <em>raw</em>. But you’ve got to <em>massage it</em> a little. Use your hands to <em>tear out</em> the <em>centre rib</em> from each leave. Then, working with <em>a few leaves</em> at a time, <em>mash</em> them <em>in your palms</em> before slicing. The <em>pressure</em> will <em>break down</em> some of the <em>connective fibres</em> of the plant, making them <em>easier to chew</em>. If your salad is <em>more kale</em> than lettuce, consider <em>tossing</em> in the dressing <em>15-20 minutes</em> before serving. </p>
<p> <strong>Carrot</strong>—Use a <em>cheese grater</em> to <em>shred</em> carrots. It’s <em>faster</em> than <em>chopping</em> and the <em>texture</em> is great in a salad. </p>

<p> <strong>Cucumber</strong>—Most of us have <em>been burned</em> by trying to eat a <em>hard</em>, dry <em>pickling cucumber</em>. So when we see the variety of cucumbers in the aisle, we may be weary and default to the <em>English</em>, a perfectly <em>respectable cucumber</em>. But try the <em>more flavourful Persian</em>. <em>Before slicing</em> the small cucumber, <em>bash it</em> a bit with the <em>hilt of your knife</em>. This <em>softens</em> it up and <em>releases</em> its <em>juices</em>. </p>
<p> <strong>Sprouts</strong>—Sprouts are <em>yummy</em>, <em>crunchy</em> and <em>good for you</em>. But they’re not very hearty once they’ve been harvested. Try to <em>use</em> them <em>as soon as possible</em>. </p>
<p> <strong>Beets</strong>—Did you know you can eat <em>beets raw?</em> Sometimes I <em>roast</em> them for salad. But if you have a <em>food processor</em>, just <em>peel</em> and <em>quarter</em> them, then <em>pulse</em> until they are the <em>size of gravel</em>. When adding to a salad, beets work better as <em>garnish</em>, as they tend to <em>turn everything pink</em> if added to the mix. </p>
<p> <strong>Nuts and seeds</strong>—Literally <em>any nut</em> or <em>seed</em> will give your salad <em>crunch</em> and <em>protein</em>. I <em>premix</em> a <em>big batch</em> about <em>once a month</em>. Here’s my Method. On a <em>baking sheet</em>, <em>mix</em> some <em>nuts</em> and <em>seeds</em> (I use almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds) with <em>olive oil</em>, <em>honey</em>, <em>salt</em> and <em>pepper</em>. <em>Bake</em> at <em>300F</em> until the kitchen <em>smells like nuts</em>, about <em>10 minutes</em>. <em>Remove</em> from oven and <em>cool</em> before storing in a <em>lidded container</em>. </p>

<p> <strong>Onions</strong>—I’ve heard a lot of <em>wild theories</em> on how to <em>avoid crying</em> when <em>cutting onions</em>: light a candle, wear goggles, freeze, soak in cold water, hold bread in your mouth. They are all <em>nonsense</em>. There is, however, a <em>trick</em> to quickly make <em>raw onions</em> more <em>palatable</em>. <em>Before any other part</em> of your salad, <em>slice</em> your <em>onions</em> and <em>soak</em> them in <em>whatever acid</em> you’re using <em>for dressing</em>. By the time you chop the rest of your vegetables, the onion will have <em>mellowed a bit</em>. </p>
<p> <strong>Cheese</strong>—It can seem like <em>a cheat</em>. Parents use cheese to get kids to eat vegetables. But used sparingly, a <em>crumbled tablespoon</em> of <em>feta</em> or <em>shaving</em> of <em>parmesan</em>, adds a lot of dimension to a salad. In salad diplomacy, everything is open to negotiation if it gets the necessary parties to the table. </p>
