steps:
  - step: For the best results I’d sprinkle the ribs with salt first.
  - step: Place your ribs in a pan and warm them up at about 350F, then jack the oven to full blast (or a broiler setting if you have it) for a few minutes to finish.
    notes:
      - The first step will reheat and the second step will turn the surface a pleasing sticky texture. But you’ve got to stay on top of it to see that it doesn’t dry out.
      - It’ll help to baste the meat with your reserved fat and/or stock. If you dust it with a bit of sugar or honey right before the broiling stage, the sugar will caramelize. But it’s a short distance between caramelization and burning. So watch it closely.
