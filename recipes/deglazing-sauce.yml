    notes:
      - The _wine_ should _quickly boil_ as it hits the pan. This is called _deglazing_.
  - step: Using a _spoon_ or _spatula_, _scrape_ the surface of the _pan_ to _extract_ as much of those _bits_, up into the _liquid_, as possible.
  - step: _Add_ some _butter_ to the pan and _swirl_ with the _wine_. It should quickly _emulsify_ into a _silky sauce_ for you to _pour over_ the chicken.
