    X-display_name: Dried _beans_
    notes:
      - Use any kind you like!
steps:
  - step: To start, _soak_ your _dried beans_ in _water_.
    notes:
      - If you use _hot water_, they will be _ready sooner_, in an hour or two. If you use _cold water_, leave them _overnight_.
      - You can even leave them soaking in water _for days_, though you'll need to _refrigerate the mixture_ and _change the water_ once a day.
  - step: In the morning, _strain_ the beans; place them _in a pot_ and _cover_ them with _new_, lightly salted _water_.
  - step: _Heat_ the _pot_ to a _gentle boil_, cook until the beans are _soft_, then strain.
    notes:
      - Watch that you _don't boil too hard_, as this makes beans _mushy_.
      - As they cook, a bit of _foam_ may form on the _surface_ of the _water_. Just _scoop_ this away with a _slotted spoon_.
      - The _cooking time_ will vary, less for _small beans_ (black, navy, cranberry) and more for _big beans_ (kidney, lima, chickpea). Depending on _how much water_ they've absorbed, you may be boiling your beans for anywhere from _15 minutes_ to _an hour_.
      - _Lentils_, because they are _very small_, _do not_ require soaking.
